This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n      fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n      until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n      }).then(function (comments) {\n        // The user's comments are now available\n      });\n      ```\n\n      If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n\n      ```js\n      findUser().then(function (user) {\n        return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n      }).then(function (comments) {\n        // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n      }, function (reason) {\n        // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Simple Example\n      --------------\n\n      Synchronous Example\n\n      ```javascript\n      var result;\n\n      try {\n        result = findResult();\n        // success\n      } catch(reason) {\n        // failure\n      }\n      ```\n\n      Errback Example\n\n      ```js\n      findResult(function(result, err){\n        if (err) {\n          // failure\n        } else {\n          // success\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Promise Example;\n\n      ```javascript\n      findResult().then(function(result){\n        // success\n      }, function(reason){\n        // failure\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Advanced Example\n      --------------\n\n      Synchronous Example\n\n      ```javascript\n      var author, books;\n\n      try {\n        author = findAuthor();\n        books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n        // success\n      } catch(reason) {\n        // failure\n      }\n      ```\n\n      Errback Example\n\n      ```js\n\n      function foundBooks(books) {\n\n      }\n\n      function failure(reason) {\n\n      }\n\n      findAuthor(function(author, err){\n        if (err) {\n          failure(err);\n          // failure\n        } else {\n          try {\n            findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {\n              if (err) {\n                failure(err);\n              } else {\n                try {\n                  foundBooks(books);\n                } catch(reason) {\n                  failure(reason);\n                }\n              }\n            });\n          } catch(error) {\n            failure(err);\n          }\n          // success\n        }\n      });\n      ```\n\n      Promise Example;\n\n      ```javascript\n      findAuthor().\n        then(findBooksByAuthor).\n        then(function(books){\n          // found books\n      }).catch(function(reason){\n        // something went wrong\n      });\n      ```\n\n      @method then\n      @param {Function} onFulfillment\n      @param {Function} onRejection\n      @param {String} label optional string for labeling the promise.\n      Useful for tooling.\n      @return {Promise}\n    */\n      then: lib$rsvp$then$$default,\n\n    /**\n      `catch` is simply sugar for `then(undefined, onRejection)` which makes it the same\n      as the catch block of a try/catch statement.\n\n      ```js\n      function findAuthor(){\n        throw new Error('couldn't find that author');\n      }\n\n      // synchronous\n      try {\n        findAuthor();\n      } catch(reason) {\n        // something went wrong\n      }\n\n      // async with promises\n      findAuthor().catch(function(reason){\n        // something went wrong\n      });\n      ```\n\n      @method catch\n      @param {Function} onRejection\n      @param {String} label optional string for labeling the promise.\n      Useful for tooling.\n      @return {Promise}\n    */\n      'catch': function(onRejection, label) {\n        return this.then(undefined, onRejection, label);\n      },\n\n    /**\n      `finally` will be invoked regardless of the promise's fate just as native\n      try/catch/finally behaves\n\n      Synchronous example:\n\n      ```js\n      findAuthor() {\n        if (Math.random() > 0.5) {\n          throw new Error();\n        }\n        return new Author();\n      }\n\n      try {\n        return findAuthor();
